📌 TaskFlow – Full Stack CRUD Application

TaskFlow is a full-stack CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) web application built to manage data efficiently through a simple and intuitive interface. Users can add new records, view existing data, update information, and delete entries seamlessly.

The frontend is developed using React for a responsive user experience, while the backend is powered by Django, providing secure RESTful APIs. MySQL is used as the database to store and manage application data reliably.
